Dear HIRING MANAGER,
I am eager to express my interest in the role of Commercial, Supply Chain,
Procurement, Customs Bond, Logistics, C&F, and Banking Specialist at your
esteemed organization. I bring an extensive background in IT and systems
management, having honed my skills through professional experiences in the RMG
industry, spinning mills, textile and woven fabrics sectors, as well as the IT industry.
This diverse expertise has equipped me to manage complex processes and drive
operational excellence across multiple domains.
With a robust background in commercial, logistic & supply chain operations
enhanced by hands-on certifications in Supply Chain, Leadership, Cybersecurity,
data analytics, and IT systems, I offer a unique blend of strategic leadership and
technical expertise. Over the past 18 years, I have honed my skills through roles that
demand meticulous attention to security, data integrity, and operational efficiency.
At Epyllion Group, I led initiatives that not only managed complex import/export
and banking procedures but also implemented IT solutions to safeguard sensitive
information and optimize business processes. I possess extensive experience in
sourcing, purchasing, and effectively utilizing yarn and fabrics, and I have developed
substantial expertise in sales, support, and services for IT and networking equipment.
Additionally, I bring global experience in customs bond supervision, regulatory
compliance (including adherence to SRO guidelines), warehouse management,
logistics, C&F, and transport operations management.
My role at Shober Jonno further strengthened my technical foundation, where I
managed hardware, software, and network systems while streamlining data
management functions. These experiences, along with advanced certifications in
Cybersecurity and Python, have prepared me to seamlessly transition to IT centric
roles.
I am particularly adept at transforming data into actionable insights, mitigating
Cybersecurity risks, and driving efficiency through innovative technology solutions.
I am confident that my proactive approach and dedication to continual improvement
will contribute significantly to your teamâ€™s success.
Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to
discuss how my background, skills, and certifications align with your organizational
goals.
Sincerely,
Mahmudur Rahman
